Reference
=========

This section describes all available custom functions provided by the IBM Envizi Emissions API Excel Add-in.

Each function calls the Envizi API to calculate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions based on provided inputs.

General Notes
-------------

- All functions must be entered directly into Excel cells.
- Arguments in square brackets (``[ ]``) are optional.
- Errors are returned as Excel error messages.
- Units must follow the supported unit conventions defined in Envizi.
