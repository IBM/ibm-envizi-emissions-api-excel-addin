Troubleshooting
---------------

- **Add-in not appearing**  
   - Make sure manifest file is on network path or shared folder.
   - Ensure the manifest network path is correct and listed in Trusted Add-in Catalogs.
   - Ensure you restarted Excel after saving settings.

- **Still not working**
   - Delete the catalog path, re-add it, and restart Excel again.
   - Confirm you are running **Office 2021 or later** (older versions may not support this method).

- **Multiple add-ins**
   - If you have multiple manifest files, we recommend placing them in separate folders to avoid conflicts.
